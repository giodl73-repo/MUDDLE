# MUDDLE

MUDDLE is a shared text/ASCII interaction engine for playable rooms, commands,
state, transcripts, save/resume surfaces, and host adapters.

It is not a game by itself. It is the reusable UX layer that lets product repos
host their own playable experiences:

| Host repo | Experience |
|---|---|
| BANISH | Video-game / moving-settlement MUD-like launcher and play surface. |
| AMAZE | Escape-room rooms, locks, clues, and puzzle state. |
| TIGRIS and board-game repos | Tables, turns, pieces, and scenario rooms. |

## Workspace

MUDDLE is a Cargo workspace so the repo root stays explicit and Cargo does not
join parent workspaces accidentally.

```powershell
cargo test --quiet
```

Current crates:

| Crate | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `muddle-core` | Product-neutral rooms, exits, commands, sessions, ASCII cards, and transcripts. |

## Product boundary

MUDDLE owns interaction shape, not domain rules.

- RALLY remains the deterministic simulation, metrics, validation, and replay
  substrate.
- BANISH owns settlement/game content.
- AMAZE owns escape-room content.
- Board-game repos own rules, pieces, and scenarios.

## Non-goals

- Do not build networking/MMO infrastructure yet.
- Do not put BANISH, AMAZE, or board-game rules into MUDDLE core.
- Do not require a graphical renderer before text/ASCII contracts are stable.
- Do not make MUDDLE responsible for RALLY metrics or validation semantics.
